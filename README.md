# py-api

# This project was developed independently, with occasional use of public resources for guidance and reference:

# ChatGPT was used to assist with debugging tips, code structure suggestions, and syntax clarification. All final code was written and understood by me.

# Blog posts and technical articles were referenced to understand implementation approaches and best practices.

# For Firebase integration, I referred to the Pyrebase GitHub repository and adapted relevant code snippets to fit my use case.

# For CI/CD automation, I used GitHub Actions workflows as recommended in the official documentation, customizing them as needed for this project.

# All tools, libraries, and workflows used are open-source and publicly accessible. No proprietary or paid tools were used.
